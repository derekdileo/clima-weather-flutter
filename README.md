# Clima Weather App ‚òÅ

A mobile weather application written in Dart.

## Goal
The objective of building this app is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. The app uses time-consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet.

## What is will created
A weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by Olia Gozha which finds live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
